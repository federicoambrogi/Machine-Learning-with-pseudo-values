# Machine-Learning-with-pseudo-values
This repository contains two files:

1- Machine Learning with PV.R - Contains the code for running the example in the article "Predicting survival probabilities using pseudo-observations"
2- GBSG_sample_res.RData - contains two saved object: (1) AP with no-Inf-Err estimates for the regression models under comparison; (2) boot.r with the prediction error estimated on 100 bootstrap samples. All computations were performed on a random subsample of 200 patients from the BGSG2 breast cancer data.
